            <p>
                I believe that if a man like HIM were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world he would 
                succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it the much needed peace and happiness.
                I have prophesied about the faith of Muhammad that it would be acceptable to the Europe of tommorow as it is beginning to be acceptable to the Europe of today.
                If any religion had the chance of ruling over England, nay Europe within the next hundred years, it could be Islam.
