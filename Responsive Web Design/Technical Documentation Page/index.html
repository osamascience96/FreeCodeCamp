                The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics (its aviation unit is now part of Lockheed Martin) for the United States Air Force (USAF). 
                Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft. 
                Over 4,600 aircraft have been built since production was approved in 1976. Although no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are being built for export customers.
                In 1993, General Dynamics sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation, which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger with Martin Marietta.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fighting Falcon's key features include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps to make it an agile aircraft. 
                The F-16 has an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 locations for mounting weapons and other mission equipment. 
                The F-16's official name is "Fighting Falcon", but "Viper" is commonly used by its pilots and crews, due to a perceived resemblance to a viper snake as well as the Colonial Viper starfighter on Battlestar Galactica which aired at the time the F-16 entered service.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to active duty in the U.S. Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National Guard units, the aircraft is also used by the USAF aerial demonstration team, the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, and as an adversary/aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy. 
                The F-16 has also been procured to serve in the air forces of 25 other nations. As of 2015, it is the world's most numerous fixed-wing aircraft in military service.

            <p>
                The F-16 is a single-engine, highly maneuverable, supersonic, multi-role tactical fighter aircraft. 
                It is much smaller and lighter than its predecessors, but uses advanced aerodynamics and avionics, including the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire (RSS/FBW) flight control system, to achieve enhanced maneuver performance. 
                Highly agile, the F-16 was the first fighter aircraft purpose-built to pull 9-g maneuvers and can reach a maximum speed of over Mach 2. 
                Innovations include a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, a side-mounted control stick, and a reclined seat to reduce g-force effects on the pilot. 
                It is armed with an internal M61 Vulcan cannon in the left wing root and has multiple locations for mounting various missiles, bombs and pods. 
                It has a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than one, providing power to climb and vertical acceleration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The F-16 was designed to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. 
                The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. 
                The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. 
                The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly lower than preceding fighters; 80% of the access panels can be accessed without stands.
                The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce aerodynamic drag.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the LWF program called for a structural life of 4,000 flight hours, capable of achieving 7.33 g with 80% internal fuel; GD's engineers decided to design the F-16's airframe life for 8,000 hours and for 9-g maneuvers on full internal fuel. 
                This proved advantageous when the aircraft's mission changed from solely air-to-air combat to multi-role operations. 
                Changes in operational use and additional systems have increased weight, necessitating multiple structural strengthening programs.

                    During the Soviet–Afghan War, between May 1986 and January 1989, Pakistan Air Force F-16s shot down at least eight intruders from Afghanistan. 
                    The first three of these (two Afghan Su-22s and one An-26) were shot down by two pilots. Pakistani pilots also downed five other intruders (two Su-22s, two MiG-23s, and one Su-25).
                    Most of these kills were by AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, but at least one, an Su-22, was destroyed by cannon fire. 
                    Flight Lieutenant Khalid Mahmoud is credited with three of these kills. 
                    One F-16 was lost in these battles during an encounter between two F-16s and four Soviet Air Force MiG-23s on 29 April 1987; the pilot ejected safely. 
                    The downed F-16 was likely hit accidentally by a Sidewinder fired by the other F-16.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 7 June 2002, a Pakistan Air Force F-16B Block 15 (S. No. 82-605), flown by Sqn. Leader Zulfiqar, shot down an Indian Air Force unmanned aerial vehicle, an Israeli-made Searcher II, using an AIM-9L Sidewinder missile, during a night interception near Lahore, thus achieving the world's first air-to-air kill of a drone at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Pakistan Air Force has used its F-16s in various foreign and internal military exercises, such as the "Indus Vipers" exercise in 2008 conducted jointly with Turkey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Between May 2009 and November 2011, the PAF F-16 fleet flew more than 5,500 sorties(needs update) in support of the Pakistan Army's operations against the Taliban insurgency in the FATA region of North-West Pakistan.
                    More than 80% of the dropped munitions were laser-guided bombs. On 27 February 2019, two Pakistan Air Force F-16s, one F-16AM Block 15 MLU (S. No. 92731), flown by Wg. Cdr. Nauman Ali Khan, Officer Commanding (OC) No. 29 'Aggressor' Squadron, and one F-16BM Block 15 MLU (S. No. 92606), flown by Sqn. Ldr. Hassan Mehmood Siddiqui, both aircraft from No. 11 'Arrows' Squadron, shot down two Indian Air Force fighter-jets, one MiG-21 Bison (from No. 51 Squadron, flown by Wg. Cdr. Abhinandan Varthaman, the Squadron's OC) and one Su-30MKI (from No. 221 Squadron, callsign "Avenger") over Kashmir using AIM-120C AMRAAMS.
                    These were the first air-to-air kills using beyond visual range (BVR) missiles in South Asia.

            <ul>
                <li>On 8 May 1975, while practicing a 9-g aerial display maneuver with the second YF-16 (tail number 72-1568) at Fort Worth, Texas, prior to being sent to the Paris Air Show, one of the main landing gears jammed. 
                    The test pilot, Neil Anderson, had to perform an emergency gear-up landing and chose to do so in the grass, hoping to minimize damage and to avoid injuring any observers. 
                    The aircraft was only slightly damaged, but due to the mishap the first prototype was sent to the Paris Air Show in its place.</li>
                <li>On 15 November 1982, while on a training flight outside Kunsan Air Base in South Korea, USAF Captain Ted Harduvel died when he crashed inverted into a mountain ridge. 
                    In 1985, Harduvel's widow filed a lawsuit against General Dynamics claiming an electrical malfunction, not pilot error, as the cause; a jury awarded the plaintiff $3.4 million in damages. 
                    However, in 1989, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled the contractor had immunity to lawsuits, overturning the previous judgment. The court remanded the case to the trial court "for entry of judgment in favor of General Dynamics.
                    The accident and subsequent trial was the subject of the 1992 film Afterburn.</li>    
                <li>
                    On 23 March 1994, during a joint Army-Air Force exercise at Pope AFB, North Carolina, F-16D (AF Serial No. 88-0171) of the 23d Fighter Wing / 74th Fighter Squadron was simulating an engine-out approach when it collided with a USAF C-130E. 
                    Both F-16 crew members ejected, but their aircraft, on full afterburner, continued on an arc towards Green Ramp and struck a USAF C-141 that was being boarded by US Army paratroopers. This accident resulted in 24 fatalities and at least 100 others injured.
                    It has since been known as the "Green Ramp disaster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On 15 September 2003, a USAF Thunderbird F-16C crashed during an air show at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. Captain Christopher Stricklin attempted a "Split S" maneuver based on an incorrect mean-sea-level altitude of the airfield. 
                    Climbing to only 1,670 ft (510 m) above ground level instead of 2,500 ft (760 m), Stricklin had insufficient altitude to complete the maneuver, but was able to guide the aircraft away from spectators and ejected less than one second before impact. Stricklin survived with only minor injuries; the aircraft was destroyed. 
                    USAF procedure for demonstration "Split-S" maneuvers was changed, requiring both pilots and controllers to use above-ground-level (AGL) altitudes. 
                </li>
                <li>During the 2006 Lebanon War, a blown tire of a F-16 caused the aircraft to become unstable and crash during take-off; both pilots ejected safely.</li>
                <li>On 26 January 2015, a Greek F-16D crashed while performing a NATO training exercise in Albacete, Spain. Both crew members and nine French soldiers on the ground died when it crashed in the flight-line, destroying or damaging two Italian AMXs, two French Alpha jets, and one French Mirage 2000.</li>
                <li>On 7 July 2015, an F-16CJ collided with a Cessna 150M over Moncks Corner, South Carolina, U.S. The pilot of the F-16 ejected safely, but both people in the Cessna were killed.</li>
                <li>On 17 May 2019, a F-16 crashed into a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base in Perris, California. The pilot ejected before impact. A small fire broke out but was quickly suppressed.</li>
